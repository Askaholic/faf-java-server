/**
 * <p>Contains Spring Integration configuration classes. Spring Integration is an implementation of the <i>Enterprise
 * Integration Pattern</i> which is basically just set of components for messaging applications.</p> <p>Messages are
 * nothing but an object with some header fields and an arbitrary payload. A message can be transported from point A to
 * B via channels and it can be split, aggregated, routed, modified, intercepted and so on - just like packages in a
 * network.</p> <p>For more information on Spring Integration, see the <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/docs/current/reference/html/overview.html">Spring
 * Integration Overview</a>. For know, just know that this package contains the wiring between the parts to properly
 * move incoming and outgoing messages around.</p>
